# Super Simple Notetaker!

Super simple noteaker is a simple note taking website that supports markdown notes and audio with automatic transcripts.

## What is it now
Right now, this website is bare-bones. It's just enough to get started taking notes. Styling isn't absolutely amazing and there is a lot of work left.

## What is coming up next
Sooner, rather than later, I want to concentrate on the styling for the notes part. I'm going to have to decide on a site-wide style before adding anymore features.

Once that is done, I'll start to work on fixing a few bugs with the Markdown module (This mainly has to do with its integration with my weird system) and adding database support for the notes. 

And finally, I'm going to add the audio log support, start looking at ways to create transcripts and compressing audio files without loosing too much on quality. As well as a simple login / upload feature so I don't have to add files manually.
